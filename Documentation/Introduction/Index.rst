What does it do?
----------------

If you maintain multiple TYPO3 CMS installations it's hard to keep your eyes on every extension and their updates in TER.
This extensions does some work for you and provides a scheduler task that sends you a mail if an extension-update of a loaded extension is avialable in TER.
For each new extension-version a new mail will be sent. So if you want to skip a version, you won't recieve a mail with this extension listed every time the task is scheduled.
